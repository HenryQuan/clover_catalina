## What doesn't work
- WIFI
- Sidecar and all WIFI related features
- iMessage not tested and will never use it
- Speaker maybe even with headphone
- Disk can be slow sometimes (maybe because of HDD)

## How to have network
Download `HoRNDIS` and use `Android USB Tethering` but a dongle is better

## Storage
![screenshot from mac os](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HenryQuan/clover_catalina/master/assets/storage.png)
### SSD - System
- 128GB for Mac OS Catalina
- 372GB for Windows 10 pro
### HDD - Storage
- Formatted as `exFAT`
- 256GB for `TimeMachine`
- File sharing between Windows and Mac OS

*If you see `no enough space` while using disk utility, you have to create an `EFI` partition with at least `200MB` (199MB won't work). Also, it might be better to install Mac OS first and then install Windows*

# How to install
- Check [this guide](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/unibeast-install-macos-catalina-on-any-supported-intel-based-pc.285366/) for preparation on tonymacx86 and use it as a generic guide
- [Guide](https://github.com/shiruken/hackintosh) by shiruken for Z390I
- [Guide](https://github.com/icymind/hackintosh) by icymind for Z390I

# Extra
- You will need to use config_installer.plist during your installation and system updates
- `Clover Configuration` and `Hackintool` are recommended
- use `MonitorControl` to adjust monitor volume and brightness
- Remember to install kexts with `Hackintool`
- I couldn't get it to work with Intel Graphics only (no egpu), the best `ProductName` was macmini for me but flickering didn't stop (other names will just show a green screen
- Sadly, I had to change to an AMD card to make it work
- Wait patiently for `Time Machine` to setup
- Nvidia cards won't work and don't even try it (for high sierra and below only)
- I used `Turbo Boost Swicther` to disable intel turbo boost
- GPU is quite cool without any power management
